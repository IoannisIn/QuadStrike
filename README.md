## 🎮 Overview

QuadStrike is a hardware-only reaction game implemented on an FPGA. Each player:
1. Presses **Ready** to start their turn.  
2. Watches **six zeros** scroll in from left to right.  
3. Waits until they all go blank after a pseudorandom 1–3 s delay (via a 16-bit LFSR).  
4. Hits **React** to stop the millisecond timer.  
5. Sees their time displayed as `s.mmm` on four 7-segments.  
6. After all four players, the board lights the **winner’s LED**, shows **hex5=player#** and **hex4–hex1=winner time**.

## ✨ Features

- **4 Players** with sequential turns and per-player LED  
- **Random delay** generated by a 16-bit LFSR (1000–2999 ms)  
- **1 ms resolution** timer and fixed-point display (`1.125 s`)  
- **Debounced** Ready/React/Reset buttons with edge detection  
- **Splash animation** on power-up/reset (flash “8” on HEX0–HEX5)
- **Modular VHDL** separated into cores: `debounce`, `lfsr`, `ms_timer`, `reaction_timer`, `seg7_decoder`, `display_controller`, `fsm_control`, `top_level`.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Quartus II 13.1** (or later)  
- **Terasic DE1-SoC** development board  
- **VHDL 1076-2008** support  

## ▶️ Usage

- Open project in Quartus II, add all .vhd and .qsf.
- Compile & download to the DE1-SoC.
- On power-up/reset, splash animation runs (~1.2 s).
- Press Ready to start Player 1, hit React after blackout.
- Repeat for Players 2–4.
- Press Ready after Player 4 to announce winner.
