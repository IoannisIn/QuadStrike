# QuadStrike: 4-Player FPGA Reaction Game  

A VHDL-based reaction-timer game for the Terasic DE1-SoC, featuring four sequential players, LFSR delays, 1 ms timer accuracy, 7-segment displays, and LED indicators.

## 🎮 Overview

QuadStrike is a hardware-only reaction game implemented on an FPGA. Each player:
1. Presses **Ready** to start their turn.  
2. Watches **six zeros** scroll in from left to right.  
3. Waits until they all go blank after a pseudorandom 1–3 s delay (via a 16-bit LFSR).  
4. Hits **React** to stop the millisecond timer.  
5. Sees their time displayed as `s.mmm` on four 7-segments.  
6. After all four players, the board lights the **winner’s LED**, shows **hex5=player#** and **hex4–hex1=winner time**.

## ✨ Features

- **4 Players** with sequential turns and per-player LED :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Random delay** generated by a 16-bit LFSR (1000–2999 ms) :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **1 ms resolution** timer and fixed-point display (`1.125 s`) :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Debounced** Ready/React/Reset buttons with edge detection :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Splash animation** on power-up/reset (flash “8” on HEX0–HEX5) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- **Modular VHDL** separated into cores: `debounce`, `lfsr`, `ms_timer`, `reaction_timer`, `seg7_decoder`, `display_controller`, `fsm_control`, `top_level`. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
